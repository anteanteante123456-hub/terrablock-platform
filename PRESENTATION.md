Subject: TerraBlock Platform - Educational Redesign Complete

Hi [Colleague],

I've completed the redesign of the TerraBlock platform with an educational-first approach as discussed. The platform now focuses on building trust and explaining the value proposition rather than looking like a crypto exchange.

**Key Highlights:**
- Professional, institutional design
- Problem/solution narrative (â‚¬70B liquidity crisis)
- Separate sections for property owners and investors
- Interactive educational content
- MiCA compliance messaging throughout

**View the Platform:**
- Screenshots attached for quick review
- Live demo: http://localhost:3002 (if on same network)
- Full code available in the terrablock-platform folder

The platform successfully positions TerraBlock as an innovative real estate investment platform that happens to use blockchain, rather than a crypto exchange.

Let me know your thoughts!

Best regards,
[Your name]
